Problem Statement: Event Management System with Real-Time Updates and User Authentication

Introduction

Create an event management system that allows users to create, manage, and attend events. The system should provide real-time updates about event status and include user authentication for secure access. Use Node.js with TypeScript for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and JWT for authentication.

Features and Requirements

1. Backend - Node.js and TypeScript


Node.js Basics & Core Modules: Develop a Node.js backend using TypeScript to handle event management operations. Utilize core modules such as http, path, and events for server management, file handling, and event-driven updates.
Asynchronous Programming: Use async/await for handling database operations related to event creation, updates, and user management. Ensure smooth handling of real-time data updates.
TypeScript Features: Define entities like Events, Users, and Registrations using TypeScript. Employ classes, interfaces, enums, and decorators to ensure type safety and robust code.
Real-Time Updates: Implement real-time updates for event status and notifications using WebSockets or similar technologies. Ensure efficient data broadcasting to connected clients.

2. Frontend - Angular


Angular Overview & Architecture: Build the frontend application using Angular to provide an intuitive interface for managing events, registering for events, and receiving updates.
Angular CLI & Build Process: Use Angular CLI for initial project setup and manage builds with JIT and AOT compilation to optimize performance.
Modules & Components: Develop Angular modules and components to represent various parts of the system, such as event lists, registration forms, and real-time update displays.
Data Binding & Directives: Implement Angular data binding to connect the frontend with backend data. Use directives like ngIf, ngFor, and ngSwitch to manage dynamic content and user interactions.
Services & Dependency Injection: Create Angular services for interacting with the Node.js backend. Use dependency injection to manage service instances and component interactions.
Forms & Validation: Implement Angular forms for event creation, registration, and user authentication. Include validation rules to ensure accurate data entry and improve user experience.
Routing: Configure Angular routing to enable navigation between different application views, such as event details, registration pages, and user profiles.

3. Authentication - JWT


Introduction & Structure: Implement JWT authentication to manage secure user access. Understand the structure of JWT tokens, including the header, payload, and signature.
Token Management: Handle the generation, issuance, and verification of JWT tokens for user authentication. Ensure secure token storage and management practices.
API Security: Protect backend APIs with JWT-based authentication to restrict access to authorized users and ensure data security.

4. Real-Time Updates


WebSocket Integration: Use WebSockets to provide real-time updates on event status, new registrations, and notifications to users. Ensure that updates are delivered efficiently to all connected clients.
Event-Driven Notifications: Implement event-driven mechanisms to trigger notifications for changes in event status or new user registrations.

Implementation Steps

1. Backend Development:


Set up the Node.js server using TypeScript to manage events, user registrations, and real-time updates.
Implement JWT authentication to secure user access and manage sessions.
Integrate WebSocket or similar technologies for real-time updates and notifications.

2. Frontend Development:


Build the Angular application to provide a responsive interface for event management, registration, and real-time notifications.
Develop Angular services to interact with the backend API and handle real-time updates.
Ensure the frontend integrates seamlessly with the WebSocket for live updates.

3. Testing:


Conduct comprehensive testing of backend functionalities, frontend components, and real-time features to ensure correct operation and performance.
Perform unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate the complete system.
